# Fantasy Hockey Dashboard

A simple way to view stats from an ESPN Fantasy Hockey league.

Check out the website [here!](https://weakbox.github.io/Fantasy-Hockey-Dashboard/)

## Description

Earlier in the year, I created a matchup plot generator in Python for our fantasy hockey league. While this worked well, I had to manually add the scores each week which was a huge pain. To remedy this, I turned it into a simple web app that pulls up-to-date info from ESPN directly.

## Features

* **Automatic Calculation**: Matchup scores and results are calculated automatically in real-time.
* **No-Fuss Interface**: View every matchup at once, for quick comparasion.
* **Detailed Insights**: Each matchup can be expanded to provide detailed statistics and plots.
* **Flexibility**: Compatable with any public ESPN Fantasy Hockey head-to-head points league.
* **Dark Mode**: Both light and dark interfaces are provided.

## Notes

The site is currently configured to show both the Stick & Puck League and the Upper Miramichi Hockey League.
