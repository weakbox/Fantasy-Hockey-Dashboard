# Project Title

Fantasy Hockey Dashboard

## Description

Earlier in the year, I created a matchup plot generator in Python for our fantasy hockey league. While this worked well, I had to manually add the scores each week which was a huge pain. To remedy this, I turned it into a simple web app that pulls up-to-date info from ESPN's Fantasy API.
